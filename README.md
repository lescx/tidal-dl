# `tidal-dl` â€“ "Tidal Media Downloader"

`tidal-dl` lets you archive music from Tidal.

I forked [Yaronzz](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader) project after it developed in the wrong direction and in a slow pace in my opinion. Still, this project uses many lines of the original code under the hood.

## Disclaimer

* Private use only.
* You need a paid Tidal-HIFI subscription.
* You are not allowed to use this to share or pirate music.
* It may be illegal to use `tidal-dl` in your country.

## Installation / Developing 

### 0. Prerequisites

* Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your system.
* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) if you haven't already (it's great!). You can install it using pipx:

```shell
pipx install poetry
```

For other installation methods, see Poetry's [official docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

### 1. Install Dependencies with Poetry

Use Poetry to install the project's dependencies and set up a python `venv` virtual environment:

```shell
poetry install
```

This command will create a virtual environment for your project and install all required dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

If you want to activate the virtual environment to work within it, you can use:

```shell
poetry shell
```

Activating the virtual environment is optional but highly recommended.

### (Do Your Development and) Run Your Program

```shell
poetry run python tidal_dl/__init__.py
```
