# `tidal-dl` â€“ "Tidal Media Downloader"

`tidal-dl` lets you archive music from Tidal.

I forked [Yaronzz](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader) project after it developed in the wrong direction and in a slow pace in my opinion. Still, this project uses many lines of the original code under the hood.

## Disclaimer

* Private use only.
* You need a paid Tidal-HIFI subscription.
* You are not allowed to use this to share or pirate music.
* It may be illegal to use `tidal-dl` in your country.


## Installation / Developing 

### Prerequisites

* Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your system.
* I recommend installing the project dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). If you used `pipx` before, you can install it with this command:

```shell
pipx install poetry
```

For other installation methods, see Poetry's [official docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

### Setup Development Environment with Poetry

Use Poetry to set up a python `venv` virtual environment and install the dependencies. After that you can develop and run your stuff in the `venv` environment.

```shell
poetry shell                            # 1. setup development environment
poetry install                          # 2. install dependencies
poetry run python tidal_dl/__init__.py  # 3. start program
```
